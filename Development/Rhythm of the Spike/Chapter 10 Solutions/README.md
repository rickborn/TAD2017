Chapter 10 Solutions

Each solution is a function that is self-contained. However, please ensure that Chapter 10â€™s files (particularly the .mat files) are within this folder or within your MATLAB working directory. If not, then the various commands load('Ch10-spikes-#.mat') will fail. Some of the functions use the Chronux toolbox, so make sure that is in your MATLAB directory as well.
