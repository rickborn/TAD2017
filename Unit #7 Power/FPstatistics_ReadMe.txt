Note for the False-positive Statistics: The code that solves the homework problem is 'dfSim.m', but it uses the helper function 'SampleSizeDF.m'. I did it this way because I originally wanted to reproduce figure 2 in the Simmons et al. paper ('SampleSizeDF.m'), which is the idea that the p-value is doing a kind of random walk as we add more data and re-test. Once I had generated this function, I just used it as the basis for the main simulation. Note also that I wasn't initially sure that any old random distribution would work, so I played around with this until I convinced myself that it didn't matter.
